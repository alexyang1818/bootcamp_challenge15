## Linear Regression to Predict MPG
A multiple linear regression based on each vehicle's MPG and its length, weight, spoiler angle, ground clearance and AWD type has determined that vehicle's length and ground clearance provided a non-random amount of variance to the MPG values according to the p value. Please refer to the following figure for more details.

The slope of the linear model is not zero because the parameters of the linear regression model for vehicle_length and ground_clearance are non-zero.

According to the R-squared value, which is equal to 0.7149, this linear model predict the MechaCar prototypes effectively.
